# Imperative Code Writing Golden Rules

## A. Simplicity over architecture

Prefer simplicity over architecture. Avoid premature abstraction and over-engineering.

## B. Keep it short

Functions should not exceed ~20 lines.

## C. Balanced tree design

Split responsibilities evenly across components. Keep the main function/class as a thin, flat orchestrator that coordinates smaller, focused functions.
